        "\n",
        "> **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, a leading cloud provider, launched **Snowmobile** in 2016 to address the challenge of transferring massive datasets (up to 100 PB) from corporate data centers to its cloud. By driving a 45-foot truck equipped with a secure storage container to customer sites, AWS transfers data at 1 **Tbps**, then uploads it to services like **Amazon S3 or Glacier**.  \n",
        ">\n",
        "> This reduces transfer times from **26 years (via internet)** to **six months (using ten trucks)**, enabling faster cloud adoption. Snowmobile supports **Big Data Analytics** by providing data for machine learning, business intelligence, or predictive modeling on AWS platforms like **EMR or SageMaker**.  \n",
        ">\n",
        "> Priced at **$0.005 per GB per month**, Snowmobile helped companies like **Maxar** migrate petabytes efficiently, boosting operational efficiency and innovation. 🚀\n",
