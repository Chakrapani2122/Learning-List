        "### üîπ **Types of Backup**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Full Backup**:\n",
        "   - A **complete copy** of the entire database is made. It includes all the data, schema, and objects.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If the database has tables `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Course`, a full backup will include all the data from these tables and their structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Advantages**:\n",
        "   - Easy to restore: since it's a complete copy, it can be restored directly.\n",
        "   - **Disadvantages**:\n",
        "     - Takes more time and storage space.\n",
        "     - Not suitable for frequent backups in large databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Incremental Backup**:\n",
        "   - Only the **changes** (new or modified data) made since the last backup are copied.\n",
        "   - **Example**: After a full backup, an incremental backup will only copy the rows inserted or modified since the last full or incremental backup.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Advantages**:\n",
        "   - Faster and takes up less storage compared to full backups.\n",
        "   - **Disadvantages**:\n",
        "     - Restoration is slower because it requires the full backup and all subsequent incremental backups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Differential Backup**:\n",
        "   - Copies all data that has changed since the last **full backup**.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If you made a full backup on Sunday, the differential backup on Wednesday will include all changes made since Sunday.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Restoring from Backup**:\n",
        "   - In the event of a failure, the database can be restored from a **backup** (full, incremental, or differential).\n",

        "   - **Rollback**: Used to undo incomplete or failed transactions during recovery.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **System Crash**:\n",
        "   - After a crash, the DBMS will automatically roll back incomplete transactions (using **rollback**) and apply any committed transactions (using **rollforward**) to restore the database to a consistent state.\n",
