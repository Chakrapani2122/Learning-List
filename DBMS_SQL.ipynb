        "   \n",

        "   - **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a record in a table.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Basic SQL Syntax Structure:\n",
        "1. **SQL Keywords**: SQL statements are usually written using specific keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`).\n",
        "2. **Statements**: SQL queries are called statements and end with a semicolon `;` (though in some systems, it may not be required).\n",
        "3. **Clauses**: SQL queries are typically composed of clauses like `WHERE`, `FROM`, `ORDER BY`, etc.\n",

        "🔑 **Key Points**:\n",
        "- SQL is **case-insensitive**: `SELECT` is the same as `select`.\n",

        "#### Common SQL Data Types:\n",
        "1. **Numeric Types**:\n",
        "   - **INT**: Stores integer values (whole numbers).\n",
        "   - **DECIMAL**, **FLOAT**: Used for storing decimal numbers (i.e., numbers with a fractional part).\n",

        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE TABLE employee (salary DECIMAL(10, 2));\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - **Explanation**: The `salary` column is set to store decimal numbers with up to 10 digits, 2 of which can be after the decimal point.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Character/String Types**:\n",
        "   - **VARCHAR**: Variable-length strings (text).\n",
        "   - **CHAR**: Fixed-length strings.\n",
        "   - **TEXT**: Large amounts of text data.\n",
