        "## 💡 Common Mistakes or Confusing Points\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Indentation in Python**: Python relies on indentation to define the block of code that belongs to the `if`, `else`, `match`, etc. Make sure you consistently use either spaces or tabs for indentation.\n",
        "   - Example of incorrect indentation:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if age >= 18:\n",
        "     print(\"You are an adult.\")  # IndentationError\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using `=` instead of `==`**: Remember that `=` is used for assignment, while `==` is used for comparison in `if` conditions.\n",
        "   - Incorrect example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if age = 18:  # This will raise a SyntaxError\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Match-Case vs If-Else**: `match-case` is more powerful than `if-else` for matching against multiple conditions and is more readable in some cases, but it is only available in Python 3.10+.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Using `elif` incorrectly**: The `elif` statement is used to check multiple conditions if the previous conditions were `False`. However, `elif` is not mandatory and can be omitted if only `if` and `else` are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   if age > 18:\n",
        "       print(\"Adult\")\n",
        "   elif age > 13:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Default Arguments**: Be cautious with mutable default arguments (e.g., lists). They retain their value between function calls.\n",

        "     ```python\n",
        "     def append_to_list(value, lst=[]):\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`*args` and `**kwargs`**: These allow for flexible argument passing, but remember:\n",
        "   - `*args` collects positional arguments into a tuple.\n",
        "   - `**kwargs` collects keyword arguments into a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Function Annotations**: They are optional and serve as metadata. They do not affect runtime behavior but can be useful for documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scope Confusion**: Be aware of variable scope—modifying a global variable inside a function requires the `global` keyword.\n",

        "1. **Connecting to a Database**: Use the respective database library (`sqlite3`, `mysql-connector`, `psycopg2`) to connect to a database.\n",
        "2. **Performing SQL Operations**: Use SQL commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` to interact with the data.\n",
        "3. **Transactions**: Commit changes to make them permanent or roll them back to undo them.\n",
        "4. **Error Handling**: Handle errors using Python's `try-except` mechanism.\n"
