        "   - **Solution**: Always install R first, then install RStudio.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Not Updating R and Packages Regularly**: R and its packages are continuously updated. Failing to update them can result in bugs or missing features.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Regularly update R by visiting the CRAN website, and you can update R packages in RStudio by running:\n",
        "     ```r\n",
        "     update.packages()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Wrong Environment Variables**: Setting incorrect paths for R libraries or R home directory can cause issues when trying to load libraries or run scripts.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Ensure the **R Home Directory** and **library paths** are correctly set. Use `R.home()` to check the home directory and check `.libPaths()` for library paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Confusion Between Working Directory and R Home**: The **working directory** is where your files are saved, while **R Home** is the installation directory.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: To set your working directory, use:\n",
        "     ```r\n",
        "     setwd(\"path/to/your/directory\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     To check your current working directory, use:\n",
        "     ```r\n",
        "     getwd()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dependencies and Libraries**: Some R packages require other packages to function correctly. Installing a package may fail if its dependencies aren't installed.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use `install.packages(\"package_name\", dependencies = TRUE)` to automatically install dependencies along with the package.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Incorrect Version of R for Specific Packages**: Some packages require a certain version of R to function properly. Trying to install a package with an older version of R may not work.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Keep your R updated to avoid such issues or check the package documentation for the required R version.\n",

        "- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error**: Random Forest has a built-in cross-validation method called **Out-of-Bag error**.

The final OOB error is the average error across all trees.\n",
