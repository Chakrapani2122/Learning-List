    "#### **What is Statistics?**\r\n",
    "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make decisions. In simpler terms, it helps us understand patterns, trends, and relationships in data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Types of Statistics**\r\n",
    "There are two main branches of statistics:\r\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**: These help us describe, summarize, and organize data. Examples include calculating the average of a dataset or understanding how spread out the data is.\r\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics**: These allow us to make predictions or inferences about a larger group (population) based on a smaller sample of data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Populations vs. Samples**\r\n",
    "- **Population**: This is the entire group we are interested in studying. For example, if we want to know the average height of all students at a university, the population would be *all students*.\r\n",
    "- **Sample**: Since it's hard to study an entire population, we often take a small portion called a sample. For example, we might select 100 students from the university to estimate the average height.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\r\n",
    "1. **Variable**: A variable is any characteristic or attribute that can take different values. For example, height, age, and income are all variables.\r\n",
    "   - **Quantitative Variables**: Variables that can be measured numerically (e.g., height in centimeters).\r\n",
    "   - **Qualitative Variables**: Variables that describe qualities or categories (e.g., favorite color, gender).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Data**: Data are the values of the variables. For instance, if height is the variable, the data might be 170 cm, 165 cm, etc., for different individuals.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Types of Data**\r\n",
    "1. **Nominal Data**: This is categorical data without any order. For example, gender (male, female) or types of pets (dog, cat).\r\n",
    "2. **Ordinal Data**: This is categorical data with a meaningful order, but the difference between the values is not important. For example, a satisfaction rating (poor, average, good).\r\n",
    "3. **Interval Data**: This is numerical data where the differences between values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point. For example, temperature in Celsius (0°C does not mean \"no temperature\").\r\n",
    "4. **Ratio Data**: This is numerical data with a true zero point, meaning zero represents the absence of the quantity. For example, weight (0 kg means no weight).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Measures of Central Tendency**\r\n",
    "These help us summarize the center of a dataset:\r\n",
    "1. **Mean (Average)**: The mean is the sum of all the data value$$divi thenumber ofpoints.\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\tet{= \\frac{\\text{Sum of al da$$ values}}{\\text{Number of data values}}\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: Suppose we have the ages of 5 p$$ple:5, 3, 35, and 40. The mean is:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{$$an} = \\frac{20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40}{5} = 30\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the same ages (20, 25, 30, 35, 40), the median is 30 (the middle value). If we had another age, say 45, the median would be the average of 30 and 35:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{Median} = \\frac{30 + 35}{2} = 32.5\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: If we have the following data for shoe sizes: 7, 8, 7, 9, 10, the mode is 7 because it appears twice, while all others appear once.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Measures of Spread (Variability)**\r\n",
    "These tell us how spread out or concentrated the data is:\r\n",
    "1. **Range**: The difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: For the ages 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, the range is:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{Range} = 40 - 20 = 20\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Variance**: The variance measures how far each data point is from the mean. It’s calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum (X - \\text{Mean})^2}{n}\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "   where \\(X\\) represents each data point, and \\(n\\) is the number of data points.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**: This is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of spread in the same units as the data.\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\text{Variance}}\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: For a dataset where the mean age is 30, if the variance is 25, then the standard deviation is:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",

    "\r\n",

    "   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{60 + 70 + 80 + 90 + 100}{5} = 80\r\n",

    "   \r\n",
    "2. **Median**: When ordered (60, 70, 80, 90, 100), the middle value is 80.\r\n",

    "### **Statistics 705: Day 2 – Introduction to Probability**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On Day 2, we'll begin introducing probability, a fundamental concept in statistics. Understanding probability is essential because it helps us quantify uncertainty and make predictions based on data. Here’s a detailed lesson plan, along with simple examples.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **What is Probability?**\r\n",
    "Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It ranges from 0 to 1:\r\n",
    "- A probability of **0** means the event is impossible.\r\n",
    "- A probability of **1** means the event is certain.\r\n",
    "- A probability of **0.5** means the event is equally likely to happen or not happen.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Key Terminology in Probability**\r\n",
    "Before we dive into calculating probabilities, let’s define a few important terms:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Experiment**: Any process that generates a set of results. For example, rolling a die or flipping a coin.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "2. **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment. For instance, getting a 6 when rolling a die is an outcome.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, when rolling a die, the sample space is:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Event (E)**: A subset of the sample space. An event is a specific outcome or set of outcomes we're interested in. For example, the event of rolling an even number is:\r\n",
    "   \\[\r\n",
    "   E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\r\n",
    "   \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **Basic Probability Formula**\r\n",
    "The probability of an event \\(E\\) is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (outcomes in the event) to the total number of possible outcomes (the sample space).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\\[\r\n",
    "P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in sample space}}\r\n",

    "3. **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, rolling a 2 and rolling a 5 on a single roll of a die are mutually exclusive because only one of these can happen.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other. For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events.\r\n",

    "\\[\r\n",
    "P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\r\n",
